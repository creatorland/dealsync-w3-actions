// Read-only eligibility query for scan_complete webhook (first completed LOOKBACK only).
// Uses CTEs — unlike row-level builders in deal-states.js — OK for this analytics-style read.
// Parity: backend/src/services/dealsync-v2.sync.service.ts (getSyncStatus, isFirstCompletedSync)
// Plan: docs/plans/2026-04-16-scan-complete-w3-cron-tech-spec.md
