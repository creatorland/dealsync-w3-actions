# Writing Prompts for Eval — Agent Instructions

This is for AI agents writing or modifying classification prompt variants for the A/B eval framework.

## What the system enforces

The eval uses `json_schema` structured output, which constrains the model's response at the token level. You do **not** need to specify JSON format, field types, or output structure in the prompt. The schema handles:

- Field names and types (`thread_index`, `is_deal`, `ai_score`, etc.)
- Required vs optional fields
- Root object shape (`{ "results": [...] }`)

## What your prompt must be compatible with

Your prompt controls **how** the model reasons about classification. The schema controls **what** it outputs. They must agree on allowed values:

**category** (when `is_deal=true`) — must be one of:
- `new` — brand reached out, creator hasn't responded
- `in_progress` — active conversation or negotiation
- `completed` — deal closed, deliverables confirmed
- `not_interested` — creator declined, ghosted, or brand rejected
- `low_confidence` — might be a deal but unclear
- `likely_scam` — scam indicators present

**deal_type** — must be one of:
- `brand_collaboration`, `sponsorship`, `affiliate`, `product_seeding`, `ambassador`, `content_partnership`, `paid_placement`, `other_business`

**ai_score** — integer 1-10 (clamped by the system if out of range)

**ai_summary** — max 1000 chars. The current production prompt uses a semicolon-delimited format (`brand:; contact_name:; contact_email:; contact_title:; contact_company:; contact_phone:; outreach_type:; offer:; deliverables:; comp_cash:; comp_currency:; comp_product:; comp_commission:; comp_notes:; timeline:; status:; next_steps:; links:; context:`). If your prompt changes this format, downstream parsing may break. Keep the format unless you're also updating the parser.

**main_contact** — string (email address of primary external contact), not an object.

**likely_scam** — boolean. The system also sets this to `true` if `category` is `likely_scam`.

## What you can freely change

- Deal vs not-deal classification rules
- Scoring guidelines and thresholds
- Scam detection heuristics
- Category assignment logic
- How the model interprets email content
- Any reasoning instructions

## What to omit

- JSON output format examples (the schema handles this)
- Field type definitions
- "Return a JSON array" instructions
- Output structure descriptions

These are redundant with the `json_schema` and can confuse the model if they conflict with the enforced schema.

## Tips

- Focus on classification logic, not output format.
- Use `low_confidence` liberally — the eval measures whether deals are caught, not whether uncertain ones are perfectly categorized.
- Test with `runs=10` for stable metrics. Single runs have too much variance.
- The user prompt template (`prompts/user.md`) injects `{{THREAD_DATA}}` — don't change this unless you're also updating the code.
- Check `eval/thresholds.json` for current pass/fail criteria before evaluating.
- See `prompts/system.md` for the current production prompt as reference.

## Archiving results

After running an eval comparison, archive results to `eval/history/` following this structure:

```
eval/history/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>/
  README.md          ← findings, verdict, decision, next steps
  system-a.md        ← variant A system prompt
  system-b.md        ← variant B system prompt
  user-a.md          ← variant A user prompt
  user-b.md          ← variant B user prompt
  result-a.json      ← variant A eval result (full JSON)
  result-b.json      ← variant B eval result (full JSON)
```

The README should cover: what was tested and why, configuration, metrics tables, regressions, verdict, decision, and next steps. See [eval/history/2026-04-17-v1-vs-v3/](history/2026-04-17-v1-vs-v3/) for a complete example.
